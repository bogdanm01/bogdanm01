# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hey there, I'm Bogdan â€“ a full stack developer with a passion for React, Node, and all things related.

## About Me

I spend most of my time crafting full stack solutions with React and Node. I also dabble in Angular and UI design because a good user experience is just as important as a solid backend.

- **Favorite Coding Snack**: Coffee.
- **Spirit Animal**: The Phoenix â€“ rising from the ashes of failed code to create something better.
- **Motto**: Deadlines don't exist.

Thanks for stopping by! Happy coding! ðŸš€
